	<h2>cricket world cup</h2>

	<p class="quote">	
		It may be a surprise for readers outside the former British Empire to learn that the Cricket World Cup is one of the world’s biggest sporting events.

Thanks to passionate South Asian support, the tournament attracts billions in broadcast and sponsorship revenues, while the selection of England as host means tickets have been hard to come by.

This is partly because English cricket grounds are smaller than those in India and Australia for example and partly because the British public has a proven track record of attending major sporting events.

But it's also because the U.K. has significant Indian, Pakistani, Australian and South African communities, among others.

	<p>
	This summer could be the biggest in English cricketing history. Not only is it the World Cup, but England takes on Australia for ‘The Ashes' in the longer form of the game (Yes, the one that lasts five days).

Meanwhile, next summer, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) launches ‘The Hundred’ – a new 100-ball format of the game designed to attract new audiences.

What all of this means for organizers is that there are multiple demographics that must be reached, whether they are English or Indian, young or old, a new fan or a potential convert.

	For Steve Elworthy, the Managing Director of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, the task of serving the aims of both the ECB and the International Cricket Council (ICC) started a long time ago. He and his team have created a digital strategy encompassing everything from content to ticketing to drive engagement.</p>
